MetaGame
--------

This app allows you to easily prototype game ideas on an Android device.  There are two modes: game
creation and play.

Game Creation
=============

During this phase, you can add and edit:

* Boards - static images that other pieces can be put on.
* Tokens - movable images.
* Random generators - can generate numbers.
* Decks - Sets of tokens with two sides (cards).  Any pile of cards can be shuffled, dealt, or have
the top card flipped.

Create the visual look of each game element by drawing it with your finger or using a photo.

Play
====

Interact with the the pieces designed in the first phase to see how your game plays.
